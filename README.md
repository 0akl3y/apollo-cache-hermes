### Local Development

If you're looking to contribute some code, it's pretty snappy to start development on this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/convoyinc/apollo-cache-hermes
cd apollo-cache-hermes
npm install

# Leave this running while you're working on code â€” you'll receive immediate
# feedback on compile and test results for the files you're touching.
npm run dev
```

### Forks

This repo is fork- and git-friendly!

```json
"apollo-cache-hermes": "convoyinc/apollo-cache-hermes#master"
```

If you depend on a specific git branch or commit, the package [will compile itself](scripts/postinstall.sh) during install.  This makes it easy to test out pull requests before they're merged into `master`.
